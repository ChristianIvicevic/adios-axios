					<H2>TLDR?</H2>
					<P>
						Axios was once a convenient library that utilized{' '}
						<Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest">
							<Code>XMLHttpRequest</Code>
						</Link>{' '}
						in web browsers and the{' '}
						<Link href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html">
							<Code>http</Code>
						</Link>{' '}
						module in Node environments. However, in today&apos;s modern development landscape, this approach
						has been surpassed by the native Fetch API, which offers consistent functionality across browsers,
						Node, and even other environments.
					</P>
					<P>
						With the adoption of a unified API like Fetch, you can easily eliminate Axios as an additional
						dependency in your modern codebase, resulting in reduced bundle sizes. Moreover, the Fetch API has
						undergone full standardization, unlike Axios, which comes with its own set of nuances that often
						catch developers off-guard. This includes differences in how fetch and Axios handle promise
						rejection in various scenarios.
					</P>
					<P>
						Furthermore, certain frameworks, like Next.js, have begun exposing additional features within the
						Fetch API that may not be readily accessible when using Axios.
					</P>
				</section>
				<section>
					<H2>The Fetch API is available across all environments</H2>
					<P>
						Since the release of Node 18 in April 2022, the Fetch API, which had been implemented in browsers
						for over a half decade by that point,{' '}
						<Link href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v18-release-announce#fetch-experimental">
							became available by default in Node
						</Link>
						. In September 2023, Node 16, the last Long-Term Support (LTS) version that did not include the
						Fetch API by default,{' '}
						<Link href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/nodejs16-eol">
							reached its end of life and is no longer maintained
						</Link>
						. Consequently, all LTS versions of Node, as well as other runtimes like Bun, now include the
						Fetch API by default (see also <Link href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_fetch">Can I use...</Link>{' '}
						and the{' '}
						<Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API#browser_compatibility">
							MDN Browser Compatibility on fetch
						</Link>
						).
					</P>
				</section>
				<section>
					<H2>Handling errors is more natural with the Fetch API</H2>
					<P>
						When using either Axios or the Fetch API, you&apos;ll be working with promises. In both cases,
						these promises will resolve once the server&apos;s response is received. Notably, the Fetch API
						only{' '}
						<Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#:~:text=rejects%20when%20a%20network%20error%20is%20encountered%20(which%20is%20usually%20when%20there%27s%20a%20permissions%20issue%20or%20similar)">
							&quot;rejects when a network error occurs (typically due to permission issues or similar
							problems).&quot;
						</Link>{' '}
						In all other scenarios, including when the server responds with a status code like 404, the
						promise resolves and the response object is returned and can be inspected for additional logic.
					</P>
					<P>
						In contrast, the Axios implementation rejects the promise if the returned status code falls
						outside the 2xx range (which is configurable via{' '}
						<Link href="https://axios-http.com/docs/handling_errors">
							<Code>validateStatus</Code>
						</Link>
						), if no response is received, or if any other issues occur while setting up the request (see also{' '}
						<Link href="https://axios-http.com/docs/handling_errors">Handling Errors</Link> in the Axios
						docs).
					</P>
					<P>
						Although it&apos;s a matter of subjective interpretation, one can make a case that certain
						situations, like handling redirects falling within the 3xx status code range, should not trigger
						an error. Typically, it is discouraged to raise an error unless the circumstances are
						unrecoverable or so critical that they significantly disrupt the ongoing operation of the
						application, such as a genuine network error.
					</P>
				</section>
				<section>
					<H2>Incompatibilities with Next.js</H2>
					<P>
						With the introduction of the App Router in Next.js 13, developers gain access to granular caching
						options like{' '}
						<Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#fetch-optionscache">
							<Code>cache</Code>
						</Link>
						,{' '}
						<Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#fetch-optionsnextrevalidate">
							<Code>revalidate</Code>
						</Link>
						, and{' '}
						<Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#fetch-optionsnexttags-and-revalidatetag">
							<Code>tags</Code>
						</Link>{' '}
						that can be seamlessly integrated with the Fetch API. These options are processed by the
						underlying server using a custom implementation of <Code>fetch</Code> to modify caching behavior.
						In contrast, Axios lacks support for these new custom options, forcing developers to resort to
						less granular caching alternatives in the form of{' '}
						<Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config">
							route segment configuration options
						</Link>
						.
					</P>
				</section>
				<section>
					<H2>Reusing standard web APIs</H2>
					<P>
						Unlike Axios, which introduces its own abstractions and API design, the Fetch API is a
						standardized web API built on classes and functions familiar to developers across various use
						cases. For instance, explicitly using methods like{' '}
						<Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json">
							<Code>Response.json</Code>
						</Link>
						,{' '}
						<Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/formData">
							<Code>Response.formData</Code>
						</Link>
						, or{' '}
						<Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/blob">
							<Code>Response.blob</Code>
						</Link>{' '}
						instead of relying on automatic data deserialization. This opens up opportunities for lazy
						evaluation of incoming streams and results in cleaner code, typically adding just one extra line
						compared to what Axios would have provided.
					</P>
				</section>
				<section>
					<H2>The Fetch API is truly isomorphic</H2>
					<P>
						The term &quot;isomorphic&quot; is a fancy way of saying &quot;it works on both the client side
						and the server side.&quot; However, unlike Axios, the Fetch API is implemented identically in both
						environments, making it much easier to ensure the correctness of your code.
					</P>
				</section>
				<section>
					<H2>What about the convenience of Axios?</H2>
					<P>
						Axios offers a great deal of convenience by automatically handling tasks like setting HTTP methods
						or headers, particularly for content types. When using the Fetch API, these aspects might require
						manual configuration unless you create custom, reusable functions to abstract them according to
						your requirements. Alternatively, you can explore a dedicated wrapper for the Fetch API called{' '}
						<Link href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky">
							<Code>ky</Code>
						</Link>
						, which provides similar functionality while remaining a small, self-contained dependency that you
						can consider adding to your project.
					</P>
				</section>
				<section>
					<H2>Migrating off of Axios to the Fetch API</H2>
					<P>
						Unless you opt for a dedicated wrapper like{' '}
						<Link href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky">
							<Code>ky</Code>
						</Link>
						, as mentioned earlier, you will need to manually migrate certain features that Axios conveniently
						offers out of the box.
					</P>
					<P>
						For request cancellation, you would need to utilize an{' '}
						<Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController">
							<Code>AbortController</Code>
						</Link>
						, a part of the standard web APIs. Handling request retries, perhaps incorporating exponential
						backoff, would involve writing custom code tailored to your specific requirements.
					</P>
					<P>
						Additionally, other features you might consider migrating include{' '}
						<Link href="https://axios-http.com/docs/interceptors">interceptors</Link>, which can be easily
						implemented as small, reusable functions that you can apply to response objects.
