# Adios Axios

A literal single-page application listing compelling reasons to replace Axios with the native Fetch API.

## Contributing

Clone the project, run `pnpm install` in the root directory, edit [`apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`](./apps/web/src/app/page.tsx) directly to see your changes and open a PR back to the repo with your changes.

Since the page is designed to be fairly simple there is no need for Markdown (yet).
